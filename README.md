Project that attempts to mix music and artificial intelligence. The basic idea is to let a neural network study the differences between a 7th chord, 
and the same chord with tensions added to it, making it able to "tense" any sound. This is done making it analyze the Fourier transform of little bits of 
the audio samples. Right now it doesn't work, and since neural networks are black boxes, it is difficult to say why, therefore the project might be in development
for quite a long time.
